    "### Prerequisite concepts\n",
    "- **Stochastic process**: a sequence of random variables understood to have happened over a course of time\n",
    "    - At every new unit of time, variables can assume one of many possible values\n",
    "    - Each value has a probability associated with it\n",
    "    - Cannot know the exact values a variable will take\n",
    "    - Instead can make inferences based on the aforementioned probabilities\n",
    "    - **Bernoulli process**: set of iid (independent and identically distributed) variables following a Bernoulli distribution\n",
    "        - Simplest form of a stochastic process\n",
    "        - Independent: outcome of one observation does not affect other outcomes\n",
    "        - Identically distributed: each variable is drawn from the same distribution\n",
    "- **Random Walks**: a sequence of random variables\n",
    "    - Random variables are iid\n",
    "    - **Simple random walk** \n",
    "        - Size of each step in the sequence is fixed (equal to 1)\n",
    "        - Only the direction is random\n",
    "    - **Symmetric simple random walk**:\n",
    "        - Probability of step is 0.5\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stationarity\n",
    "- Stationary vs drift\n",
    "    - **Stationary**: process where future value is expected to be where the process is currently (expected value is 0-\n",
    "    - **Drift**: process that is expected to deviate from its current position\n",
    "- A time series has **stationarity** if a shift in time doesn't cause a change in the shape of the distribution\n",
    "    - Properties of the distribution such as mean, variance, covariance are constant over time\n",
    "    - Series is without seasonality and trend\n",
    "- Intuitively, a stationary process is one that does not evolve statistically\n",
    "    - Example: placing a drop of ink into a glass of water\n",
    "        - Immediately after the drop of ink, the water is clear with a small black speck\n",
    "        - Ink starts to diffuse and the speck grows\n",
    "        - This will continue until the whole glass is a uniform black color\n",
    "        - Once the ink has permeated the entire glass of water, nothing much else will happen\n",
    "        - The ink will never spontaneously return to its initial state\n",
    "    - The ink particles behave as **random walks**\n",
    "        - Each particle wanders off in its own direction\n",
    "        - Cannot get more random once the ink is distributed uniformly throughout the glass\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of stationarity\n",
    "- Strict stationarity\n",
    "    - Series where joint distribution of any moments of any degree within the process is never dependent on time\n",
    "    - In practice, this definition is too strict to be used for any real-life model\n",
    "- First-order stationarity\n",
    "    - Series where means that never change with time\n",
    "    - Any other statistic (e.g. variance) can change\n",
    "- Second-order stationarity (also called weak stationarity)\n",
    "    - Series mean, variance, and autovariance are constant over time\n",
    "    - Other statistics can change over time\n",
    "    - Constrained version of strict stationarity, very common\n",
    "- Trend-stationarity\n",
    "    - Models fluctuate around a deterministic trend (the series mean)\n",
    "    - Amplitude (height of one oscillation) is constant across the series\n",
    "- Difference-stationarity\n",
    "    - Models that need one or more differencings to become stationary\n",
    "\n",
    "### Determining stationarity\n",
    "- Can't usually determine a model is stationary or not by looking at a graph\n",
    "- Hypothesis tests for stationarity\n",
    "    - Run sequence plot\n",
    "    - Unit root tests\n",
    "        - Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test\n",
    "        - Zivot-Andrews test\n",
    "    - KPSS test: run as a complement to the unit  root tests\n",
    "    - Spectrum analysis based tests: less common tests\n",
    "        - Priestly-Subba Rao (PSR) test\n",
    "        - Wavelet-based test"
